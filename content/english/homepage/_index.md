      - "[PancakesCon](https://pancakescon.com/)and ComfyCon AU have a shared history, to the point that we are only days apart in age (PancakesCon being wiser of course). We both wanted to meet the need of COVID - a shared environment to have a casual conference, with people talking about things that interest them and the rest of the community. You can be at home, in your pyjamas, drinking a beer, and you are more than welcome."
      - This year will be slightly different. We will have a mammoth 18 hour conference, starting in Australia and New Zealand, and moving across the Pacific to the US, and into Europe. 
      -  We welcome all Australian and New Zealand speakers (although international speakers are welcome too if you want to stay up late!) to talk about Cyber Security, and Cyber Security Adjacent topics, close to their hearts.
