Ryan's the co-founder and Chief Operating Officer of Retrospect Labs. With a background in Incident Response (having spent a number of years working in - and eventually leading - the ACSC's Incident Response team), he's more recently joined the startup world, founding Retrospect Labs in early 2020. Not from a technical background (humanities for the win!) but having worked in cyber for over ten years now, Ryan brings a unique lens to cyber security - private sector challenges, government, policy, incident response, leading teams, communicating technical concepts to non-technical audiences, and of course cyber security exercises are his experiences and strengths.
