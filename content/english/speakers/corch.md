By day Corch is an outspoken independent cybersecurity consultant, the self-titled "Chief Trouble Shooter" of his own one-man empire - Shogun Cybersecurity. By night he is a mediocre gamer, decent Wadaiko drummer, never-quite-made-it DJ, hopeless coffee addict, devoted dachshund-daddy, begrudging gym attendee, and a will-get-back-to-it-one-day-I-swear rock climber.

Corch is a regular speaker at the Australian Cyber Conference on topics ranging from diversity and inclusiveness, to SIEM for small business, and privacy on the web. With a passion for hacking and security that began with watching the movie War Games as a kid, he has a life time of stories to tell, and experience that touches everything from system hardening to NIST CSF. Above all else in his professional life, Corch relishes working on difficult technical problems, and he lives by a simple motto: RTFM.
