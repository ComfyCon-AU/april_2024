Having run my own cyber security startup for a few years now (since the start of 2020!) there are a few observations and lessons learned that I'm excited to share! I'll focus on some of the things that I believe have made a difference for starting, running, and growing a cyber security startup - both from a consultant/services perspective, as well as building product (and how to manage doing both at the same time!). I'll talk about my journey, what I learnt doing a startup accelerator program, what I didn't learn doing a startup accelerator program (aka what they don't teach you!), the stuff I had to figure out on my own, my successes and my failures, and the way that my approach and journey has been unique (how i didn't follow all the advice I was given, and where that has taken me). It'll be an honest and frank sharing session, hopefully with a few interesting insights and observations!
