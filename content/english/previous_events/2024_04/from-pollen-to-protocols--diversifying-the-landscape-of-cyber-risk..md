Iâ€™ll be exploring risk assessment and management through a rather unique lens - the urban planning blunder of a city that solely planted male trees 40 years ago, leading to widespread asthma and hayfever in its inhabitants. This seemingly unrelated example illustrates a fun lesson on the importance of diversity in decision-making in cyber security risk analysis.
Drawing parallels to the world of cyber security, I'll delve into the significance of incorporating diverse voices in risk management and incident response. A homogeneous approach, much like the uniform tree planting, can lead to unforeseen threats and vulnerabilities.
