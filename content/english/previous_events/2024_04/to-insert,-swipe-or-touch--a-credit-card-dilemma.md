Overview
It you have ever bought anything with a credit or debit card (and who hasnâ€™t?), this presentation is for you.
These cards have become a normal part of our lives but we often don't think about the security that surrounds them. In this talk I will be going over the in-built security within credit cards, the security of how we pay for things in-store and the GRC security frameworks surrounding credit cards. There will also be an in-depth look into the more technical aspects of how EFTPOS/Pin-Pad devices accept payments and how difficult it would be to intercept credit card information. The aim is for you to feel more aware of the cybersecurity foundations in place surrounding how we pay and the plastic (or metal) cards that communicate those payments.
