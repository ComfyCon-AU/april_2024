Born from a challenge to make Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) more interesting than watching paint dry, this talk explores the what, where, why of GRC and how as security professionals, we all can have a part to play. Wherever you are in your security journey and whatever your role, you may be surprised at the impact you make through GRC.

GRC is more than just checklists and tick boxes. It's a commom language based on risk, that can be used communicate security to individuals and businesses alike in a way they can understand.

This talk will (re-)introduce: what GRC is; common risk frameworks and standards you may encounter in your travels; some of the mechanisms, laws and agencies in Australia; and how these work together to encourage organisations to continously consider, adhere and improve their security.
