Have you ever found that every security initiative fails despite the best of intentions? That no matter how hard you work, progress seems forever out of reach? And despite the proselytising of the agile movement and the army of SAFe consultants, everything is still just too damn hard?

You're not alone.

Through working with enterprises around the world, I have seen this unfortunate pattern play out time and time again. In this talk we'll explore the mental models, principles and practices that paint a potential path out of this Sisyphean nightmare.

You'll learn:
- How architecting the business is more important than architecting the solution.
- Why security doesn't seem the same benefits from agile way of working.
- How to plan your work to deliver the best possible outcome for your Herculean effort.
