Another day, another big company making layoffs. It’s terrifying isn’t it? Cyber Security has enjoyed high salaries for a long time but unfortunately, this can make us a bigger target in times of cut backs. I’ve been there - I was made redundant in January 2023. This talk is my chance to make something good from a bad experience! I’ll be sharing the things that genuinely helped me get through and bounce back, plus some other things I wish I’d thought to do in advance. Come and learn from my mistakes.
