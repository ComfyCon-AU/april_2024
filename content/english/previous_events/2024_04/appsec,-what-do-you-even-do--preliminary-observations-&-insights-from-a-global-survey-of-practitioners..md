Build it right. Cyber Security begins with the applications we build. 
So, naturally, how do I get into AppSec? This shouldn’t be a hard question… right? Especially for those of us AppSec Professionals in the OWASP Education & Training Committee. In 2020, we asked this question as part of the OWASP How to Get into AppSec Project, returning with more questions than answers.

What even is AppSec? What do we actually do in our roles?

We asked the brain trust at the OWASP Foundation, and we couldn’t come to a consensus. So, if we don’t know what the benchmark is ourselves, how do we help those seeking to get into AppSec meet it? How do we even communicate what value that we deliver, when it isn’t clear what we do.

To answer these questions, we did a survey of AppSec Practitioners to understand the landscape of practice, with over 700 practitioners responding. In this presentation, we’ll share the preliminary observations from the survey data that we collected, and the insights gained thus far. Although preliminary, and painting with broad strokes, hopefully this helps support more informed decisions, on how we can build a cyber-safe future together.
