As a casual biohacker I want to do a talk on how technology is helping in data driven insights, and how these insights can be used to optimise stress management, mental health and wellness. Iâ€™ll touch on the security risks associated and some of the ultra high tech approaches. 

I have a second talk, I could do relating to security and these kinds of technologies also.
