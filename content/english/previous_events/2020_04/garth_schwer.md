For both crisis professionals and professionals in crisis, this session examines the effects of long term stressors, and provides a practical framework on how to manage them. Topics include crowd psychology during disaster events, recognising personal coping mechanisms, cross-cultural contemplation frameworks, and examples of high-stress professionals using said techniques to maintain their "calm within the storm".
